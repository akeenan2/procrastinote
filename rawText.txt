 
Gender studies is a field for interdisciplinary study devoted to gender identity and gendered representation as central categories of analysis
 This field includes women's studies (concerning women, feminism, gender, and politics), men's studies and queer studies
[1] Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of sexuality
 
These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature, language, geography, history, political science, sociology, anthropology, cinema, media studies,[2] human development, law, and medicine
[3] It also analyzes how race, ethnicity, location, class, nationality, and disability intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality
 
Regarding gender, Simone de Beauvoir said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one
"[6] This view proposes that in gender studies, the term "gender" should be used to refer to the social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities and not to the state of being male or female in its entirety
[7] However, this view is not held by all gender theorists
 Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see Sociology of gender), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and feminists such as Judith Butler
