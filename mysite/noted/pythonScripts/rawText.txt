 Create and Practice Your Game Plan Key: 

 Before an assignment means "ESSENTIAL for upcoming class
" For the Math books, these assignments are crucial in order to understand and participate in the upcoming class
 All of the vocab lists are starred simply because it would be impossible to "cram" those after the class ends; you must do vocab every week (and nearly every day) in order to achieve a high verbal score
 
 Before an assignment means "IMPORTANT
" You certainly want to do these assignments before taking the GRE, and it would be best to do the assignments during the week listed on the syllabus
 However, you will still be able to understand and participate in class if you cannot get to these assignments on time
 ( ) No stars before an assignment means "Optional
" Reference Material : A list of math conventions (math vocabulary and GRE "ground rules") is located in the Official Guide, pp
 133 - 142
 This may be especially helpful for those who learned math in another language or who are less familiar with American standardized tests
 Helpful Tips:  If your class skips a week due to a holiday, or if you have extra time for any reason, it is always acceptable to work ahead
  If you miss a class, it is not necessary to "catch up" on that class before attending the next one
 The classes function independently, so your main priority should be preparing for the next class that you are about to attend
