In philosophy of mind, dualism is the position that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical,[1] or that the mind and body are not identical.
[2] Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mindbody problem.[1][2]

Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only.
 In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level.
 Thus, for Aristotle, all three souls perish when the living organism dies.
[3][4] nonphysical For Plato however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body.[5]

Dualism is closely associated with the thought of Ren√© Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical and therefore, non-spatialsubstance.
 Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence.
[6] Hence, he was the first to formulate the mindbody problem in the form in which it exists today.
[7] Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism.
 Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.
