Gender studies is a field for interdisciplinary study devoted to gender identity and gendered representation as central categories of analysis
[1] Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of sexuality

These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature, language, geography, history, political science, sociology, anthropology, cinema, media studies,[2] human development, law, and medicine
[3] It also analyzes how race, ethnicity, location, class, nationality, and disability intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality

Regarding gender, Simone de Beauvoir said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one
 Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see Sociology of gender), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and feminists such as Judith Butler
